             Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos) is a Mexican holiday that celebrates and honors deceased loved ones. Families create colorful altars, visit cemeteries, and enjoy traditional treats like sugar skulls. It's a festive yet solemn occasion that emphasizes the enduring connection between the living and the departed.

                  Visit Xcaret from October 30th to November 3rd and welcome the souls coming from beyond. Enjoy a broad activity program at the Best Park in the World when the spirits of our beloved ones return to visit their relatives and friends.

 

The 17th edition of the Festival of Life and Death Traditions has the Mexican state of QuerÃ©taro as guest of honor. Artists and artisans from this region will be at Xcaret to let us be part of their customs.

 

This year's program includes plays, dance, various concerts, All Saints Day mass, as well as various workshops, exhibitions, and the Interactive Hacienda: a space where children and adults learn and have fun with the traditions of the Day of the Dead.

 

The Day of the Dead festivities in Mexico are recognized as Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.

 

Celebrate life and death in Xcaret, the Majestic Paradise of Mexico.
